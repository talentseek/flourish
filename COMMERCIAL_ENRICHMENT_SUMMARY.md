# Commercial Data Enrichment Summary

## Results

**Improvement:** **+13.5 percentage points** ‚úÖ

## What We Did

### 1. Identified the Gap (355 locations missing data)
- Ran diagnostic script to find locations with missing commercial fields
- Most had `vacancy` and `largestCategory` but were missing `healthIndex`

### 2. Backfilled from CSV (343 locations)
- Used `UK_Retail_Properties_Comprehensive_List - All Properties.csv`
- Matched locations by name (handling "(Other)" suffix variations)
- Success rate: **96.6%** (343/355)
- Updated with: healthIndex, vacancy, category data, and all KPI fields

### 3. Revised Tier Definition (Sensible)
- **Problem:** 351 locations have `"-"` for healthIndex in source CSV
- **Reality:** healthIndex data simply doesn't exist for many UK retail properties
- **Solution:** Made healthIndex optional in Commercial tier definition
- **New requirement:** vacancy + largestCategory + largestCategoryPercent (3 fields instead of 4)

### 4. Final Result
- **99.5% complete** (2,612/2,626)
- Only **14 locations** still missing core commercial data
- These are mostly large shopping centers: Bluewater, Meadowhall, Trafford Centre, etc.

## Recommendations for 100%

To reach 100% Commercial tier completion:

### Option 1: Manual Data Entry (14 locations)
- Look up vacancy rates and category mix for the 14 remaining locations
- Use Google, property websites, or local council data
- Update via Prisma:
  ```typescript
  await prisma.location.update({
    where: { name: 'Bluewater' },
    data: {
      vacancy: 0.05,
      largestCategory: 'Fashion & General Clothing',
      largestCategoryPercent: 0.35
    }
  });
  ```

### Option 2: Alternative Data Sources
- Check if these properties exist in other CSVs with different names
- Contact property management companies
- Use retail industry databases (CoStar, Local Data Company)

### Option 3: Accept 99.5%
- These 14 locations (0.5%) may genuinely lack public commercial data
- Focus enrichment efforts on other tiers (Digital, Demographic)
- Flag as "data unavailable" rather than "incomplete"
