## Scene 1 – Opening Hook (0:00–0:30)

**On screen:**  
Flourish landing page hero.  
Slow pan over headline, subheading, and key stats (2,600+ locations, 180K+ Businesses, £250M+ NEW revenue opportunities).  
Subtle zoom on stats cards.

**NARRATOR:**  
“Every vacant unit is lost revenue and lost customer engagement.

But what if you could see exactly which tenant categories are missing from your centre… how much revenue they’re worth… and which local brands or businesses are the best fit to fill those spaces?

Flourish is a unique AI-powered retail property intelligence platform analysing over 2,600 UK retail locations and 180,000+ businesses, using over 3 million data points—analysing shopping centres, retail parks, outlet centres and high streets.

Let’s see how it helps you uncover hidden revenue and shorten the leasing cycle.”

## Scene 2 – Dashboard Overview (0:30–1:00)

**On screen:**  
Dashboard2 with sidebar, live metric cards displayed above the search interface.  

**NARRATOR:**  
“This is your command centre for retail property intelligence.

At a glance you can see live metrics across your portfolio—total locations, total stores, and how many analyses you've completed. Everything is kept up to date in real time.”

**On screen:**  
Hover over metric cards showing Total Locations, Total Stores, and Analyses Completed.  
Show the search interface below the metrics.

**NARRATOR:**  
“Flourish uses a powerful multi-stage workflow that guides you from location discovery through to comprehensive gap analysis and report generation.

Let's start by searching for a location. I'll search for Pentagon Shopping Centre in Kent.”

---

## Scene 3 – Gap Analysis: Finding the Gaps (1:00–2:00)

**On screen:**  
Gap Analysis page with search bar, configuration panel, empty map.

**NARRATOR:**  
“Gap Analysis is where Flourish turns your data into decisions. It compares your tenant mix to nearby competitors and highlights underserved categories with the highest revenue potential.”

**On screen:**  
Type “Queensgate Shopping Centre” into search.  
Map centres on **Pentagon Shopping Centre**; competitors appear.  
Adjust distance slider to 25 miles.  
Show filters for Shopping Centre / Retail Park / Outlet / High Street.

**NARRATOR:**  
“Let’s take Pentagon Shopping Centre in Kent.

We select Pentagon, and the map instantly shows nearby competitors. We can choose the catchment radius—say 25 miles—and include other assets like retail parks and outlet centres for a full picture of the local offer.”

**On screen:**  
Click **Run Gap Analysis**.  
Show brief loading state.  
Location details panel appears.

**NARRATOR:**  
“Flourish then pulls together everything you need on one screen:

- Basic details like address and number of stores  
- Operational data such as annual footfall, parking and floor area  
- Commercial KPIs including health index and vacancy rates  
- Digital presence, ratings and reviews  
- Local demographics—population, income, car ownership and more”

**On screen:**  
Scroll down to Tenant Comparison: charts & tables.  
Highlight category distribution bars and comparison table.

**NARRATOR:**  
“Then it compares Pentagon’s tenant mix with nearby competitors.

Category distribution charts show where you’re over- or under-represented, while the comparison table breaks down how your centre performs in each category against the peer set.”

**On screen:**  
Show Gap Priority cards (High / Medium / Low).  
Show Missing Businesses list.

**NARRATOR:**  
“AI models identify the gaps and rank them by priority—high, medium and low—based on demand, competitor coverage, and revenue potential.

You can even see specific brands your competitors have that you don’t. These become your target list for leasing conversations.”

## Scene 4 – Outreach: Turning Insights into Targets (2:00–2:45)

**On screen:**  
Navigate to Outreach page.  
Select Pentagon from dropdown.  
Gap cards appear: e.g. 'Fast Casual Dining', 'Premium Fashion', 'Health & Wellness'.

**NARRATOR:**  
“Insight is only useful if it turns into action. Outreach takes the analysis and turns it into a clear, prioritised action plan.

For Pentagon, Flourish AI has identified several gaps. For example, 'Fast Casual Dining' is flagged as a high-priority gap—under-represented versus similar centres within 10 miles.”

**On screen:**  
Hover over a gap card to show category, priority badge, revenue estimate, competitor coverage, rationale & suggested brands.

**NARRATOR:**  
“Each card shows the category, priority level, estimated revenue opportunity, and how competitors are currently serving that demand. It also suggests brands that are a strong fit for your centre.”

**On screen:**  
Show buttons: **Publish Franchise Opportunity** and **Local Outreach**.

**NARRATOR:**  
“From here, you can publish a franchise opportunity, or jump straight into local outreach to find real operators who could move into your vacant units.

Let’s explore Local Outreach for this fast-casual dining gap.”

**On screen:**  
Zoom into one place card showing name, address, AI blurb, contact icons.  
Show multiple cards with different brands.

**NARRATOR:**  
“Each card shows the business, location, and an AI-generated explanation of why they’re a good fit, based on category, price point, and the surrounding peer set.

Contact details—email, phone, website, social channels—are enriched automatically, so you’re not wasting time hunting for information.”

**On screen:**  
Tick checkboxes on several tenants.  
Click **Start Outreach**.  
Show AI-generated messages.

**NARRATOR:**

Flourish handles that too — by using an AI voice agent to place outbound calls and book appointments on your behalf.”

**NARRATOR:**  
“You choose the operator, set the objective, and Flourish’s AI voice agent does the rest — using the same data intelligence that powered the gap analysis.”

### AI CALL DEMO – LIVE TRANSCRIPT

**On screen:** Live transcript scrolls line-by-line.

**VOICE AGENT (AI):**  
“Hi, is that Sarah?”

**OWNER:**  
“Yes, speaking.”

**VOICE AGENT (AI):**  
“Hi Sarah, my name’s Charlene, calling on behalf of the Flourish leasing team at the Pentagon Shopping Centre in Chatham. How are you today?”

**OWNER:**  
“I’m good, thanks.”

**VOICE AGENT (AI):**  
“We’re reviewing our fast-casual dining offer at the centre, and your restaurant on the High Street came up in our data as one of the strongest local operators in that category and a perfect fit for our leasing strategy.”

**OWNER:**  
“Okay… right.”

**VOICE AGENT (AI):**  
“Don’t worry, this isn’t a sales call. We’ve identified a gap for good-quality, fast-casual dining at Pentagon compared with other centres in the area, and we’re exploring whether an additional site could be interesting for you over the next 6 to 18 months. We think your business is great and would love to have a chat.

All I’d like to do today is see if you’d be open to a short, 15–20 minute call with the leasing manager, Michelle, who can walk you through the numbers and options.”

**OWNER:**  
“Maybe – what would that involve?”

**VOICE AGENT (AI):**  
“It’s very straightforward. They’ll share:
- Footfall and catchment data for Pentagon  
- How your category is currently under-served and its potential  
- Unit sizes and rental ranges that could work for you  

There’s no commitment — it’s just an initial conversation to see if it’s worth exploring further.

Would mornings or afternoons usually work better for you?”

**OWNER:**  
“Afternoons, usually.”

**VOICE AGENT (AI):**  
“Great, thank you. Looking at next week, would Tuesday at 3pm or Thursday at 2:30pm be better?”

**OWNER:**  
“Let’s do Tuesday at 3.”

**VOICE AGENT (AI):**  
“Perfect. I’ve booked you in for Tuesday at 3pm for a 15–20 minute call with Charlene from the Pentagon leasing team. We’ll send you a quick SMS reminder with the details. Thanks very much, Sarah — have a great day.”

**OWNER:**  
“You too. Speak next week.”
