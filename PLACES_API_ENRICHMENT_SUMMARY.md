## üîë Key Insights

1. **Major centres are well-represented on Google Maps**
   - 95.3% of 50+ store locations were found
   - All results were official shopping centre websites

2. **Medium centres have lower presence**
   - 74.8% success rate for 20-49 store locations
   - Some smaller centres don't maintain Google Business Profiles

3. **Query strategy matters**
   - Primary query: `"{Location Name} {City} UK shopping centre"`
   - Fallback query: `"{Location Name} {City} UK"` (simpler)
   - 2-second rate limiting prevents API throttling

4. **Website sources**
   - Most results from Text Search API directly
   - ~10% required Place Details API call for website field
   - Some results included Google Maps URLs (should be filtered)

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. ‚úÖ **Refresh enrichment dashboard** - DONE
2. üîÑ **Run social media scraper V3** on 259 new websites
3. üîÑ **Run parking scraper V3** on 259 new websites

### Optional Follow-ups
1. **Tier 3 Enrichment** ($21.68 for 1,275 small locations)
   - Lower expected success rate (~60-70%)
   - Many small locations may not have websites
   - Consider manual verification for high-impact locations

2. **Manual Investigation** (4 remaining major locations)
   - Check if centres are closed/rebranded
   - Verify store counts are accurate
   - Search for alternative website domains

3. **Data Cleanup**
   - Filter out Google Maps URLs from websites field
   - Validate all 259 new websites are accessible
