## ✅ What to Do After Completion

1. **Refresh enrichment metrics**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/mbeckett/Documents/codeprojects/flourish
   pnpm tsx scripts/refresh-enrichment-metrics.ts
   ```

2. **Check dashboard**
   - Visit `/dashboard/admin/enrichment`
   - View updated Digital tier completion
   - Check Gap Analysis for remaining work

3. **Review logs for errors**
   ```bash
   grep -i "error" /tmp/social-v3-run.log
   grep -i "error" /tmp/parking-v3-run.log
   ```

4. **Analyze success rates**
   ```bash
   # Social Media final stats
   tail -10 /tmp/social-v3-run.log | grep "Success"
   
   # Parking final stats
   tail -10 /tmp/parking-v3-run.log | grep "Success"
   ```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If a script crashes or stops:

**Check if process is still running:**
```bash
ps aux | grep 98478  # Social Media
ps aux | grep 98978  # Parking
```

**Restart from where it left off:**
```bash
# Social Media
cd /Users/mbeckett/Documents/codeprojects/flourish
pnpm tsx scripts/enrich-social-media-v3.ts > /tmp/social-v3-run.log 2>&1 &

# Parking
pnpm tsx scripts/enrich-parking-v3.ts > /tmp/parking-v3-run.log 2>&1 &
```

The scripts are idempotent - they skip locations that already have data, so restarting is safe.

## 📋 Next Steps After Completion

### High Priority
1. ✅ Refresh enrichment dashboard
2. 🔄 Review Gap Analysis for remaining digital/operational gaps
3. 🔄 Decide on Tier 3 enrichment (1,275 small locations for $21.68)

### Optional
1. Manual verification of 4 Tier 1 locations without websites
2. Quality check on parking data (verify ranges are realistic)
3. Social media link validation (check for dead links)
4. Consider additional enrichment tiers (reviews, ratings, etc.)

## 💡 Key Insights

**Why these numbers?**
- Social Media V3 has **7 detection methods** (links, meta tags, JSON-LD, aria-labels, img alt, CSS icons, SVG)
- Parking V3 has **sitemap.xml support** and crawls up to 3 levels deep
- Rate limiting: 1-2 seconds between requests to avoid being blocked
- Expected success rates:
  - Social Media: 70-80% (very high due to modern detection)
  - Parking: 26-35% (lower because many sites don't publish parking numbers)

**Investment made so far:**
- Google Places API: $5.49
- Time invested: ~30 hours of development + testing
- Scrapers run for free (no API costs)

## 🎉 Success Criteria

After these runs complete, we should achieve:
- **✅ 80%+ of major locations** with complete social media presence
- **✅ 30%+ digital tier completion** (up from 13%)
- **✅ 11-13% parking data coverage** (up from 5%)
- **✅ Ready for Tier 3 decision** (do we continue with smaller locations?)
