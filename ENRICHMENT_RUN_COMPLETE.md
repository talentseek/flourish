## üÖøÔ∏è Phase 3: Parking V3 Scraper

### Execution Details
- **Date:** October 23, 2025 (evening)
- **Target:** All locations with websites but no parking data
- **Locations Processed:** 579
- **Success Rate:** 13.3%
- **Parking Data Found:** 77 locations
- **Duration:** ~12-14 hours

### Parking Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **New Parking Data** | +77 locations |
| **Total Coverage** | 211/2626 (8.0%) |
| **Largest Found** | 7,000 spaces (The Mall At Cribbs Causeway) |
| **Smallest Found** | 36 spaces (Windsor centres) |
| **Average Size** | ~1,200 spaces |

### Discovery Methods
1. **Sitemap.xml parsing** - Found parking-related URLs efficiently
2. **Homepage scanning** - Many centres list parking on main page
3. **Deep link following** - Checked `/parking`, `/visit`, `/getting-here` pages
4. **Multi-language support** - Handled `/en/`, `/uk/` URL patterns

### Why Lower Success Rate?
- Many centres don't publish specific parking numbers online
- Some use vague terms ("ample parking," "free parking")
- Retail parks often share parking with other businesses
- Smaller centres may not manage their own parking
