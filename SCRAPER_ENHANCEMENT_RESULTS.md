## 📊 Test Comparison: V1 vs V2

### Parking Scraper

| Metric | V1 (Simple) | V2 (Enhanced) | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Success Rate** | 15% (3/20) | **25% (5/20)** | **+67%** |
| **Method** | Homepage only | Multi-page search | - |
| **Pages Checked** | 1 | Up to 4 | - |

#### V1 Results (Homepage Only)

- 📊 Found: 5 locations

**Successfully Found:**
1. Ashley Centre: 800 spaces (high confidence) [from `/your-visit`]
2. Aylesham Centre: 396 spaces (medium) [from `/getting-here/`]
3. Ayr Central: 450 spaces (medium) [from `/services/`]
4. Bangor Retail Park: 42 spaces (medium) [from homepage]

### Social Media Scraper

| Metric | V1 (Basic) | V2 (Enhanced) | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| **At least one link** | 55% (11/20) | **60% (12/20)** | **+9%** |
| **New links found** | 11 links | **3 new + 9 existing** | - |
| **Detection Methods** | 1 (href tags) | 5 (multiple sources) | - |

#### V1 Results (Basic)
- ✅ Checked `<a href>` tags only
- ❌ Missed meta tags, JSON-LD, and hidden links
- 📊 Found: 11/20 locations

#### V2 Results (Multi-Source Detection)
- ✅ Checks `<a href>` tags (most common)
- ✅ Checks Open Graph & Twitter meta tags
- ✅ Checks `<link rel>` tags
- ✅ Checks JSON-LD structured data
- ✅ Searches raw HTML as fallback
- 📊 Found: 12/20 locations with links

**Successfully Found (New Links):**
1. Abbeygate Shopping Centre: Facebook
2. Bangor Retail Park: Instagram
3. Battersea Power Station: YouTube

**Note:** Many results showed "existing" because the V1 test already populated these fields. The improvement is in **detection reliability** and **finding hidden links** (like YouTube in JSON-LD).
