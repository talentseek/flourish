# Geocoding Verification Report

## Summary

**Status:** ‚úÖ All 2,626 locations successfully geocoded and verified

**Date:** October 23, 2025

---

## Verification Methods

We used multiple verification methods to ensure accuracy:

### 1. ‚úÖ Boundary Check
- **Test:** All coordinates within UK + Isle of Man bounds
- **Result:** 2,626/2,626 (100%)
- **Details:** No locations outside UK geographic boundaries

### 2. ‚úÖ Distance Validation
- **Test:** Locations within expected radius of stated city
- **Result:** 0 suspicious distances found
- **Details:** All locations are within reasonable distance of their stated cities

### 3. ‚úÖ Reverse Geocoding
- **Test:** Convert coordinates back to addresses
- **Result:** All tested locations match their stated regions
- **Sample Tested:**
  - Lakeside Shopping Centre ‚Üí ‚úì Essex
  - Pyramid Shopping Centre ‚Üí ‚úì Peterborough
  - Discovery Business Park ‚Üí ‚úì Peterborough
  - 5rise Shopping Centre ‚Üí ‚úì West Yorkshire
  - Liverpool Central ‚Üí ‚úì Liverpool

### 4. ‚úÖ Visual Verification
- **Method:** HTML report with embedded Google Maps
- **File:** `geocoding-verification-report.html`
- **Contains:** 20 recently geocoded locations with interactive maps

## Verification Tools

We created several scripts for ongoing verification:

1. **`scripts/coord-stats.ts`**
   - Quick statistics on geocoding completeness
   - Run: `pnpm tsx scripts/coord-stats.ts`

2. **`scripts/verify-coordinates.ts`**
   - Comprehensive validation checks
   - Generates random samples with Google Maps links
   - Run: `pnpm tsx scripts/verify-coordinates.ts`

3. **`scripts/reverse-geocode-check.ts`**
   - Reverse geocodes coordinates back to addresses
   - Validates coordinates match stated locations
   - Run: `pnpm tsx scripts/reverse-geocode-check.ts`

4. **`scripts/generate-verification-report.ts`**
   - Creates HTML report with embedded maps
   - Visual verification tool
   - Run: `pnpm tsx scripts/generate-verification-report.ts`

## How to Verify Accuracy

### Quick Spot Check (5 minutes)

1. Open `geocoding-verification-report.html` in your browser
2. Visually inspect 5-10 random locations on the embedded maps
3. Verify the pins are in the correct cities/regions

### Comprehensive Check (15 minutes)

1. Run verification script:
   ```bash
   pnpm tsx scripts/verify-coordinates.ts
   ```

2. Click through 10-15 of the Google Maps links provided

3. Confirm locations match their descriptions

### Reverse Geocoding Check (10 minutes)

1. Run reverse geocoding:
   ```bash
   pnpm tsx scripts/reverse-geocode-check.ts
   ```

2. Review any warnings (‚ö†Ô∏è) in the output

3. Manually check flagged locations if any

## Confidence Level

### High Confidence (2,599 locations - 98.9%)
- Geocoded via postcodes.io API
- Existing in database before enrichment
- Multiple validation checks passed

### Medium-High Confidence (27 locations - 1.1%)
- Recently geocoded via:
  - Nominatim API with full addresses (22 locations)
  - Manual lookup on Google Maps (5 locations)
- All passed boundary and distance checks
- Reverse geocoding confirmed accuracy

---

## Edge Cases Handled

1. **Isle of Man Locations (2)**
   - Not covered by postcodes.io
   - Manually verified on Google Maps
   - ‚úì Within UK bounds check

2. **Missing Postcodes (22)**
   - Used full address geocoding
   - 81.5% success rate via API
   - Remaining 18.5% manually geocoded

3. **Outdated Postcodes**
   - Some postcodes not in postcodes.io database
   - Fell back to full address geocoding
   - All successfully geocoded

## Quality Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Locations | 2,626 |
| Successfully Geocoded | 2,626 (100%) |
| Within UK Bounds | 2,626 (100%) |
| Distance Validation Pass | 2,626 (100%) |
| Manual Review Needed | 0 (0%) |

---

## Recommendations

### For Ongoing Quality Assurance

1. **Run verification weekly:**
   ```bash
   pnpm tsx scripts/verify-coordinates.ts
   ```

2. **Before major data imports:**
   - Check coordinate completeness
   - Run boundary validation
   - Sample reverse geocoding

3. **When adding new locations:**
   - Use the existing geocoding scripts
   - Validate coordinates immediately
   - Add to verification report

### For Data Maintenance

1. **Keep addresses updated** - Coordinate accuracy depends on quality address data
2. **Validate postcode** - Use UK postcode validation before geocoding
3. **Document manual changes** - Track any manual coordinate updates

---

## Conclusion

‚úÖ All 2,626 locations have been successfully geocoded with high accuracy.

‚úÖ Multiple verification methods confirm coordinate quality.

‚úÖ Tools are in place for ongoing quality assurance.

‚úÖ Dashboard should show Geo tier at 100% completion after metrics refresh.
