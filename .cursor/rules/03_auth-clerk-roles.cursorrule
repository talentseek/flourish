# Title: Clerk auth + roles
# Scope: project
You MUST:
- Use Clerk for auth in Next.js (App Router).
- Store app-specific roles in Clerk user public metadata (e.g., { role: "user" | "admin" }).
- Mirror essential auth data in our Prisma User table (id, email, role).
- Gate routes and UI using server-side checks (middleware or server components).
- Use webhooks to sync user.created / user.updated from Clerk to our DB.
