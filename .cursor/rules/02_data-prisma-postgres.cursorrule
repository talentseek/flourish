# Title: Prisma + Postgres conventions
# Scope: project
You MUST:
- Use Prisma as the ORM. Datasource URL comes from env var DATABASE_URL.
- Never hardcode credentials. Read from process.env.DATABASE_URL.
- Prefer `prisma migrate dev` locally; `prisma migrate deploy` in CI/CD.
- Add seed scripts under prisma/seed.ts when needed.
