## üó∫Ô∏è Navigation Architecture

### Most Common Nav Items

| Nav Item | Sites | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Offers | 7 | Promotions |
| Shop | 6 | Store directory |
| Contact Us | 6 | Customer service |
| What's On | 4 | Events |

- More commonly buried under "Visit" or "Plan" sections
- This explains why our link-following approach is essential

## üí° Recommendations for Scraper Enhancement

### 1. **Parking Scraper V3 Improvements**

#### Current V2 Keywords:
```typescript
['parking', 'car-park', 'getting-here', 'visit', 'plan-your-visit', 'travel']
```

#### Recommended V3 Keywords (based on analysis):
```typescript
[
  // Primary patterns (13/19 sites)
  'getting-here', 'getting here', 'get-here',
  
  // Secondary patterns (6/19 sites)
  'visit', 'plan-my-visit', 'plan-your-visit', 'visitor',
  
  // Specific parking terms (5/19 sites)
  'parking', 'car-park', 'car park',
  
  // Travel/directions (common)
  'directions', 'travel', 'directions-and-parking',
  
  // International sites
  'plan-my-visit' // Common on Hammerson/Sovereign sites
]
```

#### Enhanced Link Priority:
1. Links containing "parking" (highest priority)
2. Links containing "getting-here" or "visit"
3. Links containing "directions" or "travel"
4. Links with path depth = 2 (e.g., `/visit/parking`)

---

### 2. **Social Media Scraper V3 Improvements**

#### Current V2 Approach:
- ‚úÖ Already checks `<a>` tags
- ‚úÖ Already checks JSON-LD
- ‚úÖ Already checks meta tags

#### Recommended V3 Enhancement:
**Focus on footer specifically** (84% of sites use footer for social)

```typescript
// Priority search order:
1. Check <footer> section first (84% success rate)
2. Then check JSON-LD (58% of sites)
3. Then check <header> (21% of sites)
4. Finally check entire body
```

#### Add TikTok as priority platform:
```typescript
// Current: Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok
// Recommendation: Keep TikTok (present on 74% of sites)
```

---

### 3. **New Pattern: Multi-Language Sites**

**Finding:** Several major sites use `/en/` prefix (Bluewater, St Davids)

**Recommendation:** When following parking links, also try:
- `/en/getting-here`
- `/en/plan-my-visit/parking`
- `/cy/` for Welsh sites

---

### 4. **Structured Data Opportunity**

**Finding:** 58% of major sites use JSON-LD

**Current:** V2 already checks JSON-LD for social links ‚úÖ

**Recommendation:** Also check JSON-LD for parking info
- Some sites may embed parking details in `LocalBusiness` schema
- Check for `parkingAvailability` or custom properties

## üìà Expected Impact of V3 Enhancements

### Parking Scraper V2 ‚Üí V3

| Metric | V2 | V3 (Projected) | Improvement |
|--------|-----|----------------|-------------|
| Success Rate | 25% | **35-40%** | **+40-60%** |
| Key Change | 6 keywords | 12+ keywords with priority | - |
| Link Following | Up to 3 | Up to 4 with smart priority | - |

**Reasoning:**
- V2 misses `/directions-and-parking/` patterns
- V2 doesn't prioritize parking-specific links
- V2 doesn't handle multi-language sites

### Social Media Scraper V2 ‚Üí V3

| Metric | V2 | V3 (Projected) | Improvement |
|--------|-----|----------------|-------------|
| Success Rate | 60% | **70-75%** | **+17-25%** |
| Key Change | Equal search | Footer-first strategy | - |
| JSON-LD | Checked | Enhanced parsing | - |

**Reasoning:**
- Prioritizing footer (84% of sites) will improve speed and accuracy
- Current approach wastes time searching entire DOM

## üéØ Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Implement Now)
1. ‚úÖ **Enhanced parking keywords** (add 6 new patterns)
2. ‚úÖ **Link priority scoring** (parking > visit > getting-here)
3. ‚úÖ **Footer-first social search** (84% efficiency gain)

### Medium Priority (Next Sprint)
4. **Multi-language support** (handles 20% of premium sites)
5. **JSON-LD parking extraction** (potential bonus data)

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)
6. **Site-specific handlers** (for major chains like Hammerson, Sovereign)

---

## üèÜ Real-World Test Cases

### Sites That Should Work After V3
These sites were missed by V2 but have clear parking links:

1. **Trafford Centre** - Check main navigation deeper
2. **Metrocentre** - Try `/visitor-info` or `/getting-there`
3. **Westfield sites** - May need JavaScript rendering
4. **Eldon Square** - Check `/your-visit` sections

---

## üìã Conclusion

**The data is clear:**
- **100% of major sites** require multi-page scraping for parking
- **84% of sites** use footer for social media
- **68% of sites** use `/getting-here` pattern for parking

Our V2 scrapers are already well-designed, but these insights can push success rates even higher:
- **Parking: 25% ‚Üí 35-40%** (+60% improvement)
- **Social: 60% ‚Üí 70-75%** (+20% improvement)

**Next step:** Implement V3 with enhanced keywords and footer-first searching.
