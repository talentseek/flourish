---

## 9. COMMERCIAL METRICS (IF AVAILABLE)

**Health Index:**  
- Not available specifically for the centre. ONS publishes a Health Index for Medway, but the composite numeric score is not easily extractable from static pages. ⚠️  

**Largest Category (by representation):**  
- Likely dominated by **fashion & value / variety** plus **grocery-led retail**:  
  - Large Sainsbury’s and M&S, TK Maxx, New Look, Roman, Yours Clothing etc. ⚠️  

**Vacancy Rate / Vacant Units:**  
- Not given numerically. Leasing materials describe the centre as “trading exceptionally well”, with many tenants upsizing; the plan shows a small number of units under development or to let. No published percentage. ⚠️  

**Average Tenancy Length:**  
- Not found / not published. ❓  

**Percentage Multiple vs Independent Retailers:**  
- Qualitatively, the scheme is heavily weighted towards **national multiples** (Sainsbury’s, M&S, TK Maxx, boots/superdrug, banks, telecoms, national chains) with a smaller local independent presence (e.g., florist, some services/kiosks). No formal percentage breakdown published. ⚠️

## 10. DEMOGRAPHIC DATA (CATCHMENT AREA)

### 10.1 Centre Catchment (from Leasing Brochure)

- 115,900 people live within a 10-minute drive of the centre. ✅  
- 82% of customers live within a 20-minute drive. ✅  
- 62% of the 10-minute catchment are classified as “affluent-comfortable” (above the UK and South East averages). ✅  

These figures are based on Experian/retail catchment analysis used in the leasing brochure.


### 10.2 Wider Medway Demographics (Proxy)

Because detailed age and income breakdowns for the *exact retail catchment* aren’t publicly available, Medway-wide statistics are used as a proxy.

**Population (Medway):**  
- Approx. 278,000 residents (Census 2021). ✅  

**Median Age:**  
- About 38.9 years in Medway (2022). ✅  
- Slightly younger than the England and South East averages. ⚠️  

**Families Percentage:**  
- Not directly published as a simple percentage; Medway has a relatively high proportion of working-age adults and children, with around 63% of the population aged 16–64. ⚠️  

**Seniors Percentage (65+):**  
- Below the England average of c. 18–19%; exact percentage for Medway requires detailed census tables. ⚠️  

**Average Household Income (Proxy):**  
- Individual median earnings in Medway (2017) around £558.40 per week (~£29k/year). ⚠️  
- Household income is likely in the mid-£40k to £50k range, but this is an estimate, not a formal statistic. ❓  

**Income vs National Average:**  
- Medway tends to sit roughly around or slightly above the national average, but below the South East regional average; precise percentage difference is not quoted in summary stats. ⚠️  

**Homeownership Rate:**  
- Medway’s homeownership sits in the mid-60% range (around 64–67%), a few points above the England average of c. 62%. ⚠️  

**Homeownership vs National:**  
- Slightly above national average, below some more rural South East districts. ⚠️  

**Car Ownership Rate:**  
- Suburban Medway generally has car ownership above the national average (Great Britain: c. 78% of households with at least one car). Exact percentage for Medway requires more detailed census output. ⚠️  

**Car Ownership vs National:**  
- Likely above national average, consistent with the strong car-based access profile and large free car park at Hempstead Valley. ⚠️
