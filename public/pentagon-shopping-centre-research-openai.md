## 3. OPERATIONAL DETAILS

### Opening Hours (centre)

There are two slightly different sets of hours quoted. The “Getting Here” page (core mall hours) shows:  

**Core Centre Hours (most consistent recent info):** ⚠️  

- **Monday:** 08:00 – 19:00  
- **Tuesday:** 08:00 – 19:00

- **Saturday:** 08:00 – 18:00  
- **Sunday:** 10:00 – 16:00  

Another “Opening Hours” snippet shows some days closing at 18:00 (not 19:00), so treat the above as indicative and check for the latest times if needed.

> **Note:** Individual store and car-park hours vary (e.g. JD, Deichmann, Sainsbury’s etc. often 09:00–18:00 or 08:00–18:00 with Sunday 10:00–16:00).

## 6. TENANT DIRECTORY (CURRENT / RECENT)

> **Caveat:** The centre’s own store-directory page is currently behind a redirect loop, so this list relies on the click-and-collect directory, individual store pages, Wikipedia’s April 2025 list, and other third-party sources. It is very likely incomplete and may include units in the process of closing (e.g. Game). Treat as an indicative working list, not a legally reliable schedule.

**Google Rating:**  
- Approx. **3.7 / 5.0** ⚠️  

**Google Review Count / Votes:**  
- Approx. **6,700+ Google reviews** ⚠️

**Facebook Rating:**  
- The Facebook page uses **Recommendations** rather than showing a stable 1–5 star rating. No numeric rating visible in the public page snapshot. ❓  
- Facebook review/vote counts not explicitly surfaced. ❓  


---

## 9. COMMERCIAL METRICS

**Health Index:**  
- The ONS provides a **Health Index for Medway** as the local authority, but a simple numeric score for the mall’s catchment is not directly quoted in publicly accessible summaries. **Not found at centre level.** ⚠️  

**Largest Category (by presence in tenant mix):**  
- **Fashion, footwear & value general merchandise**, followed by **food & beverage** and **phone/electronics**, judging from the tenant list (New Look, JD, Foot Locker, Select, Poundland, Superdrug, Boots, etc.). ⚠️  

**Vacancy Rate:**  
- Not stated explicitly. Letting particulars list around **11 units being marketed** at the time of the 2020 brochure; with 77 units total, that would suggest something like **c. 10–15% vacancy at that time**, but this is a rough inference, *not* an official figure. ❓  

**Vacant Units (absolute):**  
- 2020 leasing brochure lists multiple vacant or re-letting units (10, 17–18, 27–28, 35, 42+FF MSU, 45–48, 51–53, 54–55, 57, F, 209a High Street). That’s ~12 line items, but some are combined units. No current 2025 vacancy schedule found. ⚠️  

**Average Tenancy Length:**  
- Not found / not published. ❓  

**Percentage Multiple Retailers vs Independents:**  
- No formal GOAD breakdown publicly available. From the store list, the centre is **dominated by national multiples** (Sainsbury’s, New Look, Boots, JD, Deichmann, Pandora, EE, O2, Foot Locker, Poundland, Superdrug, etc.) with a **smaller but significant independent & local component** (Nucleus HeART, local cafés, Mobility Hub, some specialty shops). ⚠️

## 10. DEMOGRAPHIC DATA (CATCHMENT AREA)

### Catchment (from letting brochure)

**Catchment Population:**  
- **Primary:** 128,175  
- **Secondary:** 93,096  
- **Total (primary + secondary):** ≈ 221,000 ✅  

These are **centre-specific retail catchment figures** from Experian data used in the leasing brochure.

---

### Broader Demographic Indicators (Medway-wide – used as proxies)

Because detailed age/income breakdowns for the *specific retail catchment* are not publicly available, this section uses **Medway unitary authority data** as a proxy and is marked accordingly.

**Median Age (Medway 2021 Census):**  
- **38 years** (Medway median age; younger than England’s 40 and South East’s 41). ✅  

> **Catchment Estimate:** ~38–39 years ⚠️ (assuming Pentagon catchment mirrors Medway’s overall age profile).

**Families Percentage (households with dependent children):**  
- Not given directly for the Pentagon catchment. Medway generally has a **relatively high proportion of families and working-age population (16–64: ~63%)**. ⚠️  
- **Estimated:** “Above UK average share of working-age families; exact % not found.” ❓  

**Seniors Percentage (65+):**  
- Medway’s median age of 38 implies a **lower 65+ proportion than South East average**; detailed percentage not in accessible snippets. ❓  

**Average Household Income (Medway / Kent & Medway region):**  
- Kent & Medway small-area income estimates (2019–20) give median **total weekly household income ≈ £945** – **≈ £49,000 per year**. ⚠️  
- Localised Medway examples show **average household income c. £51,800**, indicating many Medway neighbourhoods sit around **£50k**. ⚠️  

> **Catchment Estimate:** **Average household income c. £48k–£52k per year**, likely a little below the South-East regional average but slightly above or around the UK average. ❓  

**Income vs National Average:**  
- Implied **slightly above national average, but below South-East regional average**, based on Kent & Medway vs UK comparators. ❓  

**Homeownership Rate:**  
- Medway council stats: **home ownership 64.7%** in 2021 (down from 67.7%). ✅  

**Homeownership vs National:**  
- UK home ownership is typically just over 60%; Medway at **~64–65%** is **a few percentage points above** the national rate, but lower than some rural South-East districts. ⚠️  

**Car Ownership Rate:**  
- Exact % for Medway wasn’t readily accessible. Given Medway’s suburban/commuter profile and travel stats in the brochure (**33% of customers travel by car**, **76% within 20 mins**), car ownership is likely **slightly above England average** but below the most rural South-East districts. ❓  

> **Demographic Summary for Pentagon Catchment (best-effort proxy)**  
> - Population: ~221k primary & secondary catchment ✅  
> - Median age: ~38–39 years (younger than South-East, slightly younger than England) ⚠️  
> - Household income: around £50k / year on average, slightly above UK average ❓  
> - Home ownership: mid-60s %, a bit above national average ✅  
> - Car ownership: moderate–high; about one-third of visitors arrive by car according to mall survey data ⚠️

## 11. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH NOTES

**Historical Context & Architecture**  
- Built 1973–75 as part of a major **Chatham town centre redevelopment**, opening **30 June 1975**. ✅  
- Replaced several older streets (George Street, Nelson Road, Fair Row, parts of Solomons Road, Avondale Terrace).  
- Designed in a **brutalist style** with orange-red brick and grey concrete; complex includes the **Brook multi-storey car park** and **Mountbatten House** office tower. ✅  
- Originally contained an internal **Pentagon Bus Station**; this has been replaced by the external **Chatham Waterfront Bus Station** now adjacent to the centre. ✅  

**Remodelling & Changes**  
- Centre remodelled in the late 1990s: old fountain, seating, and some internal stair/escalator elements were removed; **glass scenic lifts and modern escalators** installed.  
- Historic major tenants include **C&A, Co-op Department Store, WHSmith, Wilko, JJB Sports, Bejams, Wimpy** and others; many have since closed.  
- WHSmith closed 2015; its unit later taken by Deichmann.  

**Current / Recent Developments**  
- **Mountbatten House** (integral to the complex) is being converted into residential flats, with associated improvements at the first-floor level including **Ascend coworking innovation space** and the **James Williams Healthy Living Centre**, targeted for completion around Winter 2025 (timing somewhat uncertain). ⚠️  
- Medway Council’s Chatham town-centre masterplans emphasise the Pentagon as a key element in broader urban regeneration.  

**Amenities & Facilities**  
- Facilities listed by Visit Medway: **accessible parking, accessible toilets, baby-changing facilities, free Wi-Fi, restaurants/cafés, credit cards accepted, coaches welcome, assistance dogs allowed**. ✅  
- Regular **events and markets** (e.g. Christmas events, retro toy markets, dinosaur shows, family activities), often promoted via Facebook & Instagram.  
- **Soft play and story corner** for young children is hosted at the centre as part of “For the Love of Reading” activities.  

**Performance Positioning**  
- 2016: Chatham ranked **#51 in the UK’s “Hot 100 Retail Locations”** (Property Week), noted in leasing brochure as evidence of growth potential and catchment strength.  
- Pentagon described as “dominating retailing in Chatham” and as the **prime local shopping destination** for the Medway region, with a mixture of value and mainstream brands.  

**Recent Store Changes (examples)**  
- **Game**: Kent’s final standalone Game store (in Pentagon) is scheduled to close (closure date around early 2026). ⚠️  
- **Virgin Media**: Store in the mall closed as part of a wider 2020–21 national reduction in physical stores.
