Research conducted November 18, 2025 using web searches, direct page browsing (Wikipedia, Completely Retail, Facebook), and cross-referenced news articles. Some operational details (e.g. exact current tenant list, EV points) remain limited due to lack of fully public/up-to-date directory from the centre itself.
