# **Strategic Asset Report: Dockside Outlet Centre, Chatham Maritime**

## **1\. Executive Strategic Overview**

The Dockside Outlet Centre, located at Maritime Way, St Mary's Island, Chatham (ME4 3ED), stands as a pivotal case study in the regeneration of post-industrial British heritage sites. Situated within the historic perimeter of the former Royal Dockyard Chatham, the asset represents a complex adaptive reuse project that has transitioned through multiple strategic identities since its inception. Originally developed as a traditional factory outlet centre intended to rival regional counterparts like Ashford, the centre has, under the stewardship of WD Ltd (WD Chatham Limited), pivoted toward a "hybrid" community-lifestyle model.1

This strategic realignment is a direct response to the evolving retail hierarchy of the South East. While the asset retains "Outlet" in its name, its operational reality is that of a sub-regional dominant community hub. It effectively functions by blending large-format value retail (anchored by The Range) with essential municipal services (Department for Work and Pensions), experiential leisure (Odeon, Ninja Warrior, PureGym), and a growing food and beverage precinct.3

The centre comprises approximately 160,000 to 175,000 square feet of Gross Leasable Area (GLA) spread across two levels within a Grade II listed structure—the former boiler shop of the naval yard.1 This architectural provenance provides a unique selling proposition (USP) of aesthetic heritage that modern "box" retail parks cannot replicate. However, it also imposes strict listing constraints that influence operational costs and fit-out flexibility.

Financially, the asset operates in a high-stakes environment. The catchment area, while populous (approx. 628,000), faces the "180-degree constraint" typical of coastal locations, where the catchment circle is halved by the Thames Estuary and River Medway.5 Furthermore, the demographic profile of the immediate vicinity—St Mary's Island—contrasts sharply with the wider Medway towns, necessitating a tenant mix that must simultaneously appeal to affluent local residents and value-seeking visitors from the broader catchment.

This report provides an exhaustive analysis of the Dockside Outlet Centre, examining its physical characteristics, leasing structures, tenant engineering, operational challenges (specifically regarding parking and facilities management), and its future viability within the North Kent economic framework.

## **2\. Historical Provenance and Architectural Context**

### **2.1. The Naval Legacy**

The site’s significance extends far beyond its current retail function. The Dockside Outlet Centre is physically integrated into the footprint of the Historic Dockyard Chatham, a site of global maritime importance established in 1567\.7 For over four centuries, this location was the industrial heart of the Royal Navy, responsible for the construction and maintenance of over 500 ships, including Lord Nelson’s flagship, HMS Victory.7

The retail centre itself occupies the former **Boiler Shop**, a Grade II listed building constructed to service the steam-powered ironclads of the Victorian navy.1 This massive industrial structure is characterized by its vast internal voids, exposed steel lattice girders, and significant natural light ingress through clerestory windows. Unlike purpose-built shopping malls which often suffer from low ceilings and artificial environments, Dockside benefits from an "industrial chic" aesthetic that is genuine rather than fabricated.

### **2.2. Regeneration and Adaptive Reuse**

The closure of the naval base in 1984 precipitated one of the largest regeneration projects in the UK. The transformation of St Mary's Island from a secure military facility into a mixed-use residential and commercial zone required substantial remediation, including the drainage of marshland and the importation of fill material.8

The conversion of the Boiler Shop into a shopping centre was a central pillar of this regeneration, intended to act as a commercial anchor that would draw visitors across the Medway Tunnel and onto the Island. The preservation of the building’s shell means that the retail units are effectively "pods" inserted into the historic volume. This creates a distinctive atmosphere but presents challenges regarding thermal efficiency and the adaptability of floorplates for modern retailers who often require standardized box dimensions.

The symbiotic relationship with the adjacent Historic Dockyard Trust is a critical driver of footfall. The Dockyard operates as a separate museum attraction, drawing approximately 160,000 to 180,000 visitors annually.5 These tourists, drawn by assets such as the Victorian Ropery and the submarine HMS Ocelot, provide a secondary customer base for the Outlet Centre’s dining and leisure facilities, distinct from the primary retail shopper.11

## **3\. Locational Dynamics and Connectivity**

### **3.1. Geographic Isolation and the "180-Degree" Catchment**

A critical factor in the asset's performance is its geography. Located on St Mary's Island, the centre is physically separated from the traditional Chatham High Street and the Pentagon Shopping Centre. Access is funnelled primarily through the A289 and the Medway Tunnel, or via the single bridge connection to the mainland at Chatham Maritime.13

The *North Kent Strategic Housing and Economic Needs Assessment (SHENA)* identifies a structural challenge for retail in this area: the "180-degree catchment".6 Unlike an inland city (e.g., Maidstone) which draws trade from a 360-degree radius, Chatham Maritime is bounded by the River Medway and the Thames Estuary. This geographical reality limits the natural catchment population and forces the centre to work harder to extend its draw southward and westward to compensate for the lack of population to the north and east.

### **3.2. Road Infrastructure and Parking Dynamics**

The centre serves a car-reliant catchment, necessitated by the relatively dispersed nature of the Medway towns. Access is provided via Junction 1 of the M2 motorway and the A289 Medway Towns Northern Relief Road.

Parking Infrastructure Analysis:  
The provision of parking is a contentious and evolving operational issue. The site manages approximately 1,500 spaces split between a surface car park and a multi-storey facility.13 Historically, the centre offered four hours of free parking, a massive incentive that distinguished it from town centre competitors. However, recent management decisions by Chatham Maritime Car Park Management Ltd have introduced a strict tariff regime, likely to combat "fly-parking" by students attending the nearby Universities at Medway or commuters using the location as a park-and-ride hub.14  
**Current Tariff Structure (2024/2025):**

| Duration | Tariff Cost | Strategic Implication |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **0 \- 1 Hour** | Free | Encourages "Click & Collect" and quick convenience trips (e.g., The Range, Costa). |
| **1 \- 2 Hours** | £1.25 | Monetizes the standard retail browsing trip. |
| **2 \- 3 Hours** | £2.50 | Captures revenue from dining/cinema visitors. |
| **3 \- 4 Hours** | £3.50 | Represents a cost increase for families engaging in "day out" activities. |
| **5 \- 12 Hours** | £8.00 | Penalizes all-day parking, deterring student/commuter abuse. |
| **12+ Hours** | £10.00 | Overnight rate. |

Data Source: 14

Enforcement is managed via ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) barriers. While efficient, this system has generated significant consumer friction, with reports of users confused by the payment machines or receiving fines due to entry/exit barrier misunderstandings.16 For a leisure-centric asset, friction at the point of exit is a substantial risk to repeat visitation.

Electric Vehicle Infrastructure:  
The centre has integrated EV charging to future-proof the asset, with stations provided by Allego and others. Pricing is premium-weighted (approx. 75p-84p/kWh) with aggressive overstay fees, indicating these are intended for "grazing" charges while shopping rather than long-duration destination charging.17

### **3.3. Public Transport Connectivity**

Despite the car dominance, the centre is integrated into the Medway public transport network. The absence of a rail station on St Mary's Island (the nearest is Chatham Railway Station, over a mile away) places a heavy burden on the bus network.

**Key Bus Services:**

| Route | Operator | Route Description | Frequency |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1 / 2** | Arriva | Gillingham \- Chatham \- Dockside \- University | Every 10-20 mins 19 |
| **100** | Arriva/Nu-Venture | Chatham \- St Mary's Island Shuttle | Shuttle Service 19 |
| **191** | Arriva | Grain \- Hoo Peninsula \- Chatham | Critical link for the Hoo Peninsula catchment 21 |

The reliability of these bus links is vital for staff recruitment, particularly for the younger workforce employed in the retail and hospitality units, who may not possess private transport.

## **4\. Demographic Catchment Analysis**

The demographic profile of the Dockside Outlet Centre's catchment is a tale of two distinct populations: the immediate, affluent residents of St Mary's Island, and the broader, value-conscious population of the Medway towns.

### **4.1. The Micro-Catchment: St Mary's Island**

The immediate ward of St Mary's Island (Postcode ME4 3ED and surrounds) presents a demographic profile significantly different from the national average.

* **Age Structure:** The area has a median age significantly younger than the national average, heavily skewed toward the 20–35 age bracket.22 Census data indicates a high concentration of "Empty Nesters" and young professionals attracted by the waterfront apartments.  
* **Affluence:** This micro-catchment is characterized by "average to high wealth," with very low levels of deprivation compared to the adjacent Chatham Central ward.23  
* **Ethnicity:** The area is ethnically diverse. Census 2021 data for the immediate area shows a White British population of approximately 49% to 70%, which is lower than the UK average (83%), with significant communities of Black African, Indian, and Chinese residents.22

This local demographic drives the demand for the "lifestyle" elements of the centre: the gym (PureGym), the nursery (Sea Shells), and the evening dining options (Wagamama, Zizzi). They use Dockside as their local high street.

### **4.2. The Macro-Catchment: Medway and North Kent**

The wider catchment extends to a population of 628,000 people.5 This broader demographic is historically more working-class, with pockets of significant deprivation in Chatham and Gillingham.

* **Economic Profile:** The *North Kent SHENA* report highlights that Medway has experienced slower economic recovery post-recession compared to the wider South East, with market values trending lower.6  
* **Retail Behavior:** This macro-demographic is price-sensitive, driving the performance of the "Outlet" and value retail components (The Range, Choice, M\&S Outlet, Poundstretcher—before its closure).

The challenge for WD Ltd has been to curate a tenant mix that serves the aspirational needs of the Island residents without alienating the core value-driven shopper from the mainland.

## **5\. Asset Management and Ownership Strategy**

### **5.1. Ownership Structure**

Since March 2015, the asset has been owned by **WD Ltd** (specifically the vehicle *WD Chatham Limited*), a specialist retail asset management firm.2 The acquisition price was approximately £9.1 million, a figure that reflects the asset's potential for value-add management rather than a stabilized prime yield.2

**Key Leadership:**

* **Peter Everest (Managing Director, WD Ltd):** An experienced operator with a track record of revamping distressed assets (e.g., in Newcastle and Derby). His strategy relies on heavy investment to fill voids with high-covenant anchors.2  
* **Anthony Sutton (Centre Manager):** Long-serving director (appointed 2009\) who provides continuity and deep local knowledge.4

### **5.2. The Leasing Model: Turnover Rents**

A crucial component of the centre's resilience is its leasing structure. Research indicates that the centre utilizes **turnover-based leases** alongside base rents.

* **Lease Terms:** New leases are typically offered on 10 or 15-year terms.26  
* **Rental Structure:** A typical structure seen in leasing brochures for the centre is a base rent (e.g., £22.50 \- £24,000 pa) OR a percentage of net annual turnover (typically 10%), whichever is higher.26  
* **Service Charges:** The combined service and marketing charge is approximately £6.50 \- £6.85 per square foot.26

Strategic Insight:  
This turnover model aligns the landlord's interests with the tenants'. It de-risks the entry for new brands (low base rent) but allows the landlord to capture upside when the centre performs well. It also incentivizes the landlord to invest in marketing and events to drive footfall, as they directly share in the sales revenue.

### **5.3. Pivot to "Hybrid" Usage**

In 2025, Centre Manager Anthony Sutton explicitly articulated the shift away from a pure "outlet" designation. The strategy is to reposition Dockside as a "regional retail and leisure destination" that offers "everyday convenience".4 This is a defensive moat against online retail; consumers *must* visit physically for the gym, the dentist, the nursery, or a meal, whereas they can buy discounted clothes online.

## **6\. Retail Tenant Mix Analysis**

The centre boasts roughly 160,000+ sq ft of retail and catering space. The tenant mix has seen significant churn and evolution, moving away from transient discount stores toward established high-street names operating outlet or value-format stores.

### **6.1. The Anchor: The Range**

The dominant retail anchor is **The Range**, occupying a massive 70,000 sq ft unit (previously expanded).2

* **Function:** The Range acts as the de facto department store for the centre, covering home, garden, arts, and leisure.  
* **Risk/Reward:** While it draws immense footfall, the sheer scale of this unit means the centre’s performance is heavily correlated with The Range's corporate health. Its presence serves the "new home" market of the surrounding residential developments perfectly.

### **6.2. Fashion and Apparel**

The fashion offer is positioned firmly in the "value" and "mass market" segment. It does not attempt to compete with the luxury brands of Bicester Village or the premium high street of Bluewater.

* **Key Tenants:** M\&S Outlet, Choice, Peacocks, Roman Originals, Klass, and Mountain Warehouse.13  
* **Recent Movements:**  
  * **Choice:** A long-standing tenant, Choice recently relocated to a new, upgraded 9,000 sq ft flagship unit near The Range.28 This signals confidence from a key retailer.  
  * **New Entrants:** **Lazy Jacks Clothing Company** and **Simmonds & Sons** (school uniforms) represent a diversification into niche apparel and essential family needs.3  
  * **Exits:** The departure of the **Cadbury Outlet** (after 18 years) and Poundstretcher were significant losses, reflecting wider trends in the decline of confectionery outlets and deep-discount variety stores.29

### **6.3. Home and Lifestyle**

Alongside The Range, the centre has curated a cluster of home and lifestyle brands:

* **Cooking/Interiors:** ProCook (recently opened), Julian Charles.5  
* **Specialist:** The Works (books/crafts), The Fragrance Shop, Holland & Barrett.16

Performance Metrics:  
Leasing brochures indicate that footwear retailers in the centre have achieved sales densities of up to £362 per sq ft, while anchors have reached £462 per sq ft.5 These figures suggest a healthy trading density for the asset class.

## **7\. Leisure and Hospitality Integration**

The leisure and F\&B (Food and Beverage) component is the growth engine of the Dockside Outlet Centre, driving dwell time and evening economy revenue.

### **7.1. The Leisure Anchors**

* **Odeon Cinema:** A 9-screen multiplex that draws over 400,000 visitors annually. It is the primary catalyst for the evening trade.5  
* **PureGym:** Operating 24/7, this facility anchors the first floor and generates high-frequency visits from locals.  
* **Ninja Warrior UK:** A significant new addition, this experiential leisure brand targets the family and young adult demographic, offering an active "day out" experience that cannot be replicated online.4  
* **Climbing Wall:** Plans were announced for an Olympic-standard climbing wall, further cementing the "active leisure" positioning.5

### **7.2. Dining Precinct Evolution**

The management has actively upgraded the dining offer to move beyond just "food court" fast food.

* **New Dining:** The addition of **Wagamama** and **Zizzi** represents a shift toward casual dining chains that appeal to the more affluent St Mary's Island demographic.4  
* **Fast Food Drivers:** **McDonald's** has signed a new 25-year lease on a 5,000 sq ft unit, relocating from a smaller footprint. This long-term commitment from a global giant is a strong vote of confidence in the location's footfall resilience.28 Other key fast-food tenants include Burger King, KFC, Subway, and Nando's (noted as one of the best-performing Nando's in the South East).5  
* **Independent/Local:** **Pad Thai Live** and **The Copper Rivet Distillery** (adjacent) add local flavour and uniqueness to the site.1

Catering Performance:  
Catering units have reported trading densities of up to £738 per sq ft, significantly outperforming standard retail.5 This data validates the strategy of converting retail space to F\&B use.

## **8\. Service and Community Integration**

A defining characteristic of the "Hybrid" model is the integration of non-retail services that embed the centre into the daily life of the community.

### **8.1. Government and Employment Services**

In a move that ensures 100% occupancy of harder-to-let upper floor space, WD Ltd secured leases with:

* **Department for Work and Pensions (DWP):** A 5-year lease for office space.3  
* **Reed in Business:** A 6-year lease.3

These tenants bring hundreds of staff and visitors to the site daily, providing a recession-proof baseline of footfall that supports the coffee shops and lunchtime food operators.

### **8.2. Community Infrastructure**

* **Sea Shells Nursery:** A pre-school with capacity for 72 children. This creates a "routine" footfall pattern: parents drop off children in the morning and pick them up in the evening, creating two distinct opportunities per day for retail interaction (e.g., buying dinner at M\&S or a coffee at Costa).3  
* **Healthcare:** **Smil Dental** and other wellness services occupy upper-level units, further solidifying the "one-stop-shop" convenience factor.3

## **9\. Operational Challenges and Brand Reputation**

While the leasing strategy is robust, operational management faces significant challenges that threaten the customer experience.

### **9.1. The Hygiene Crisis**

Consumer sentiment analysis reveals a critical failing in soft facilities management. Multiple reviews and reports from 2022 onwards cite the **public toilets** as being in a state of severe disrepair, described as "filthy," "appalling," and "smelling of death".2

* **Impact:** For a centre trying to increase dwell time via cinema and dining (where visitors stay for 3-5 hours), the lack of clean, functional restrooms is a catastrophic failure point. It directly undermines the "family-friendly" marketing and risks permanently alienating the affluent local demographic who have high standards.

### **9.2. Parking Friction**

The transition to a complex paid parking tariff has created friction. Reviews highlight aggression from staff and confusion over the system.2 While revenue generation is important, the "hostility" of the parking experience is a frequent complaint in the Google Reviews data.

## **10\. Competitive Landscape and SWOT Analysis**

Dockside operates in the shadow of some of the UK’s premier retail destinations.

**Direct Competitors:**

1. **Bluewater (Greenhithe):** \~15 miles away. One of Europe’s leading shopping malls. It dominates the high-end fashion and "experience" market. Dockside cannot compete on breadth of offer.  
2. **Ashford Designer Outlet:** \~25 miles away. The premier outlet in Kent. It secures the luxury outlet brands (Ralph Lauren, Nike, Gucci). Dockside effectively cedes the "Designer" outlet market to Ashford.  
3. **The Pentagon (Chatham Town Centre):** \~1.5 miles. The traditional high street competitor. Dockside generally outperforms The Pentagon in terms of safety, environment, and leisure, but competes for the same value-conscious shopper.

### **SWOT Analysis**

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
| :---- | :---- |
| **High Occupancy:** "Fully let" status in a recessionary market.3 | **Facilities Management:** Persistent complaints regarding toilet hygiene.2 |
| **Tenant Diversity:** Excellent mix of DWP, Nursery, Gym, and Retail. | **Geographic Constraint:** 180-degree catchment due to the river.6 |
| **Heritage Setting:** Unique architectural atmosphere. | **Lack of Rail:** Poor direct rail connectivity compared to town centres. |
| **Anchors:** Strong performance from The Range and Odeon. | **Identity Crisis:** Is it an Outlet? Or a Community Centre? |

| Opportunities | Threats |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Residential Growth:** Continued housing development on St Mary's Island. | **Parking Fees:** Risk of driving "quick stop" shoppers to out-of-town retail parks. |
| **Evening Economy:** Further expansion of the dining/leisure precinct. | **Retailer Insolvency:** Exposure to value chains (e.g., The Range) in a downturn. |
| **Tourism:** Better integration with the Historic Dockyard tours. | **Competition:** Aggressive expansion or renovation at Bluewater or Hempstead Valley. |

## **11\. Financial Performance Indicators**

While specific profit and loss accounts for the centre are private, leasing data provides insight into the financial health of the asset.

* **Rateable Values:** The Rateable Value (RV) for standard units is substantial. For example, Unit 48 has an RV of £23,750, with rates payable of roughly £11,970.27  
* **Rent Collection:** The use of turnover rents (10%) allows the landlord to ride the wave of inflation—as prices in shops rise, so does the rental income, providing a natural hedge against inflation.26  
* **Service Charge Efficiency:** At \~£6.50 psf, the service charge is competitive for a covered, managed centre, although tenants may question value for money given the hygiene complaints regarding communal areas.

## **12\. Future Outlook and Recommendations**

The Dockside Outlet Centre has successfully insulated itself from the "death of the high street" by refusing to be a traditional high street. By pivoting to a model that services the **life** of its residents (work, childcare, health, gym) rather than just their **consumption** (clothes shopping), it has built a defensive moat.

Strategic Outlook:  
The future trajectory of the centre is intrinsically linked to the wider "One Medway" regeneration plan. As Chatham Maritime continues to densify with more residential units, Dockside will increasingly function as the "Town Centre" for this new population, distinct from the old Chatham High Street.  
**Recommendations for Asset Enhancement:**

1. **Immediate Hygiene Overhaul:** The toilet facilities require urgent CapEx renovation and an OpEx increase in cleaning frequency. This is the single biggest drag on the centre’s reputation.  
2. **Unified Marketing with Dockyard:** A stronger joint-ticket offer (e.g., "Park at Dockside, visit the Submarine, eat at Wagamama") could unlock more value from the 160,000 annual tourists next door.  
3. **Parking Technology:** Streamlining the parking payment process (e.g., completely app-based or frictionless exit) would remove the primary friction point for casual visitors.

In conclusion, Dockside Outlet Centre is a robust, performing asset that demonstrates how retail locations can evolve. It is no longer a pure outlet; it is a modern, mixed-use community engine room housed in a spectacular 19th-century shell. Its challenge now is operational excellence to match its strategic leasing success.
