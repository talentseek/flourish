## üìà Success Rate Analysis

**Why 25% vs projected 40%?**

1. **Many locations don't have official websites**
   - Smaller retail parks
   - Local shopping parades
   - High street locations

2. **Stricter scoring than expected**
   - Score threshold of 15 was conservative
   - Many valid sites scored 10-14 and were rejected

3. **Google results quality**
   - For smaller locations, Google returns general directories
   - Few have dedicated official sites

## üéØ My Recommendation

**Hybrid Approach:**

1. **Clean up borderline sites** (remove parking/directory, keep wheree.com for now)
   - Result: ~514 websites
   
2. **Test parking scraper** on these 514 sites
   - If wheree.com sites yield parking data ‚Üí keep them
   - If not ‚Üí remove them
   
3. **Manual add top 50-100** major centres missing websites
   - Queensgate: already has
   - Westfield: already has
   - Trafford Centre: already has
   - Add others manually

4. **Accept 25-30% coverage with HIGH quality**
   - Better than 96% garbage coverage
   - Focus on actionable, accurate data
